   Q30: Would you mind sharing your Emacs configuration files?
   RMS: Configuration files are personal and will not be shared.

   This conflicts my current thoughts that I should share something to
   the world. I feel good to do so in the past, but as I write more
   and more elisp, this might not be the case anymore.
