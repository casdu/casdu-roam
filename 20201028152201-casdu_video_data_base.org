*** question

 - any cheaper computer avaiable?
 - how's performance?
** SD soution
*** something about SD card

 > When SD cards appeared, they used Microsoft’s FAT12 or FAT16 file system, so they could only store up to 2GB of data. However, SDHC cards, which use FAT32, can store up to 32GB, while SDXC cards can store up to 2TB using exFAT. With storage capacities above 16GB – typically 32GB, 64GB and 128GB – it’s rarely worth the effort of deleting photos. Just stick a new card in when the old one is full, and reformat it later if really necessary.
