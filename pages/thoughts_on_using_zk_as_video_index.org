#+TITLE: thoughts on using ZK as video index
#+filetags: casdu

** video name is uuid.{mp4, or other format}
*** but it lacks the time stamp to indicates when the video was shot
*** when try to find a related video, user may try to find from the calenda
** another issue is the time gap between the shotting time and the editting time
** maybe just leave the default time stamp created by the camera
*** adding {a,b,c,d,e,f,g} to the clip videos
