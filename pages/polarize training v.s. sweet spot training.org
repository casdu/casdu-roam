the goal is to understand the polarized training plan.

*** my opinion
**** It's fun to study, test, evaluate what I've learn
Similar to using Emacs instead of using IDE

** What is a better option when you are struggling with a workout session?
** How to tink an optimal training plan?
** How to test polarize trainig is better than sweet spot training?
*** I'd like to write a very specific step to perform a test
**** Tests base on time
***** 1,3,5,10,20,60 minutes, what's your best number?
**** Tests with mixed plan
***** The idea is to follow the attacks from the events
** How the efficiency is defined?
** How to listen to your body?
** How do you identify a plateaus?
*** not able to finish the plan
**** how the ratio is defined?
*** not able to push XXX-watts over XXX-mins duaration?
** Why no plan fits all?

We all have different backgrounds before cycling.

People have different stress in their life, e.g. from jobs, peer pressure, etc.

Motivation is different from people to people. And cycling is sometimes viewed as a mental exercise instead of the body.
** Does an extra 5 hours per week necessary?
Do you have any suggestion on a condition where 10 hours/week works just a little bit hard, but increasing the endurance training time, e.g. additional 5 hours, will it result in a better performance?
** What is the difference between Zwift customized plan and TR plan?
I hear a lots of people say how easy to make and modify the plan on TR.
** My feeling
*** I am not able to consistently train all year round and I am not sure it is due to the over-prediction FTP. If an updated plan can lower the difficulty inconsistency, but at a cost of a little bit more time, I would definitely want to try the new plan.
**** It's unclear the cost of the time and the difficulty to finish the training session
*** I personally feel not good not able to finish a sessesion but strangely, I cannot finish a session even I sometimes lower the intensity by 10%.
** Interesting post

The great thing is you can experiment on yourself and see what works and what doesn’t for you.
[/quote]

Do you have any idea on what things to look at from an individual's perspective? For example, design a protocol.

[quote="elicriffield, post:873, topic:53136"]
Without using plan builder or pre made plans, it’s just a trainer resistance controller, There are free apps that will do that, Or even a head unit you probably already have.
[/quote]

Do you have suggestions on such free software? Have you compared it with TR?

My two cents.

Higher percentages of basic aerobic work make most sense when total training time is >>8hr/wk.

Do you have any suggestion on a condition where 10 hours/week works just a little bit hard, but increasing the endurance training time, e.g. additional 5 hours, will it result in a better performance?

I want to see the trends in those large data sets, rather than handpicked anecdotes for advertising reasons.

[quote="Larzi, post:904, topic:53136"]
They have data, but don’t share them (they don’t have too).
[/quote]
Nowadays, data is more valuable than ever and there are many data restrictions for privacy concerns. I personally like to see sharing such a massive data set but I do not see it will happen soon.

Inline with you. That makes him real.

3) the less volume you do, the more intensity you do
[/quote]
Is there a sweet spot? For example, the more you do, the less intensity you do, but the more you likely to finish the training session. It seems we can draw two lines with one positive slop and the other negative, are there any intersection region?

[quote="TG333, post:826, topic:53136"]
The issue seems to be that TR is not optimizing for our personal fitness.
[/quote]

It is really hard, or I would like to say impossible to have a precise definition for optimizing. From my personal experience, I can feel a certain level of pain someday, but I can endurance more than that even the day I felt almost dead. There still a potential to do a little more. It's the nature of the mind. The pain is just a mechanism to protect our body from abuse, but it might wrong, it might over/underestimate the real situation. This makes sports science really hard to be consistent, which is one of the key values of science. Cycling is such a sport that we have such an advanced tool to analyze the data. For me, it's super fun.

[quote="old_but_not_dead_yet, post:829, topic:53136"]
Sweetspot is less than FTP, so would be zone 2, not zone 3.
[/quote]

Yes, it is at the high end of Zone-2 (3-zone theory)

I do think this thread points out to the TR team that their onboarding and maybe marketing text could use some revision so fewer people get burned out if they don’t listen to the podcast
[/quote]

I don't think either. The point is to adjust according to your need. If it's too hard, then the next time do the Ramp test, I will tell myself, don't do that hard. It's just impossible to train consistently with that high FTP. It is also possible to lower the intensity during the training but I hesitate to do that since I constantly abandon if I set the trainload too far away from my expectation. My mind will tell my body just to have rest instead of making the whole training session, which is more important. A third method is to feel the body, during the training. Which part of the body starts to feel the pain first? How the pain developed? How the breath change? Can I descript the part of my body that can feel the pain. How the pain changes over time during one training session. I find it is very interesting to observe myself. And I feel that the pain could go away if I totally focus on what I've said.
